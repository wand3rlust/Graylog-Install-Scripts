# Graylog Install Scripts

## Introduction
I happen to use [Graylog Open](https://www.graylog.org/products/source-available/) in my homelab and although the setup process is very neatly documented on the website, I thought why not refine the steps and cook couple scripts and thus this repo was born. The idea behind this was to simply run a script and have a setup ready to be configured while saving some manual labour on terminal.

**Note** --> This script installs the latest version of OpenSearch. If you're looking to use ElasticSearch, please refer to the documentation links in [References](https://github.com/wand3rlust/Graylog-Install-Scripts#references) section.
